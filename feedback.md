## Code Quality

Progressing - I would make sure to run a formatter on your code to make it really consistent. I'd also work on DRY-ing it up. You can use event bubbling or parent/child DOM traversal to do so! In addiiton, I'd use classes instead of id's for CSS as a best practice.

## Technical Requirements

Performing - Your app runs without errors and renders! It's also deployed! Fulfills all the requirements for trivia! I like how the buttons disable after answering one question.

## Creativity & Interface

Performing - Your app looks great, I love the script theme! I would maybe make the script pages into UI pages and keep the person clicking through to new pages so they don't have to scroll as far!

## Functionality

Performing - Your game works as expected!

## Presentation

Performing - I really like your readme! It's a great format and well thought through!

Great job on this project! I love the movie & script theme. I would keep working on cleaning up your code!
